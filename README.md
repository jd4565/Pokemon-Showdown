Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source code for the Pokémon Showdown! server of [Frost][3], which is mainly for Pokémon battling, competitive Leagues and fun overall.

Generally, you can find lots of commands and features on Frost that can not be seen in this repository. The reason for that is some of Frost's files are private and confidential.

Community
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pokémon Showdown! IRC channel is `#frost` at `irc.synirc.net`. However, because Frost's server itself has many more features, no-one goes there.

You can also visit the [Frost forums][4] for discussion and help.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frost's Pokémon Showdown! server is distributed under the terms of the [MIT License][5], same as that of Zarel's original repository.
